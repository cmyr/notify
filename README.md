## Status

**In development.**

- Use Tokio Reform until ecosystem stabilises.
- Use Rust beta while developing, then switch to stable for first Notify beta.

Lists are in no particular order within sections.

Before any release

- [x] Event loop running and delivering events
- [x] Better event subscriptions (done with multiqueue)
- [x] Error reporting
- [x] Runtime fallback to other methods ([#64](https://github.com/passcod/notify/issues/64))
- [x] Less depending on Life directly, more to Manager
- [x] Being able to drop backends
- [ ] Basic public (frontend) API

Release first alpha here

- [ ] Filling in capabilities
- [ ] User-provided backends
- [ ] Being able to shutdown notify
- [ ] Basic internals documentation
- All Tier 1 platforms:
  - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Linux
  - [ ] macOS
  - [ ] polling

Release second alpha here

- [ ] Debouncing
- [ ] Future-less API
- [ ] More extensive testing
- [ ] Full documentation

Release more alphas as the above gets in

Beta checklist:

- [ ] Freeze Event
- [ ] Freeze Backend trait
- [ ] Freeze Backend prelude
- [ ] Freeze public API
- [ ] Recheck all documentation (API, Wiki, Readme, Contributing, GH Templates)

Release beta here!

--------------------------------------------------

Backends that have good progress:

- [x] inotify (linux)
- [ ] fsevent (macOS, in a branch)
- [ ] polling (in a branch)

Backends needed but not started:

- [ ] Windows
- [ ] kqueue (current implementation disabled, will need a rewrite using mio directly) ([#136](https://github.com/passcod/notify/issues/136))

Delayed until after release and/or implemented by third-parties:

- All non-essential backends:
  - Remote
  - Watchman
  - [fanotify / auditd](https://github.com/passcod/notify/issues/161)
  - demo cloud storage backend
  - Dynamic
- More debouncing options (possibly via feature)
- Filesystem plugins (needed for advanced remote backends)

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
notify = "5.0.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
```

...etc...
