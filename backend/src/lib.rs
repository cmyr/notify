//! The backend interface and utilities.
//!
//! This crate contains the `Backend` trait, the `Event` type, the `Capability` enum, and all other
//! types and utilities that are needed to implement a Notify backend.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Implementors should start by including the prelude:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate notify_backend as backend;
//!
//! use backend::prelude::*;
//! ```
//!
//! And optionally the Buffer:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use backend::Buffer;
//! ```
//!
//! The prelude imports all types needed to implement a Backend, and re-exports dependent libraries
//! so there is no need to independently include them. Refer to the [implementor's guide] for a
//! thorough walk-through of backend implementation.
