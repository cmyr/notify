/// The idea is that Notify would very much like to have all or most of these things for all
/// platforms. However, making backends all do the same thing and provide the same behaviour
/// results in either **duplication** where missing duties are implemented several times in perhaps
/// different ways across backends, or **inefficiency** where backends that _can_ natively provide
/// some advanced behaviour are instead used minimally and the behaviour is then reimplemented
/// (often with bugs) on top of that.
///
/// The ideal solution is to have backends advertise which features they do support and only "fill
/// in" for them when they don't support something we require. Thus, these capabilities.
