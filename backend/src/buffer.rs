/// An internal buffer to store events obtained from native interfaces.
///
/// Some native APIs don't support returning a single event and keeping the rest, they just give
/// you everything they've gotâ€¦ but `Stream` only supports a single `Item` per `::poll()` call, so
/// the remaining has to be buffered somewhere. This is where.
///
/// Furthermore, native APIs that do have a queue generally behave badly/annoyingly when the queue
/// overflows. Instead of letting that happen, `Backend` implementations should attempt to take
/// many events from the native queue by default, and stick them in this buffer, which has more
/// predictable behaviour.
///
/// This buffer is implemented over a `VecDeque` aka a "FIFO" queue. Items are inserted at the
/// "back" of the queue and extracted from the "front". At a set limit (by default 16384 items),
/// further items are silently dropped while the queue remains full.
///
/// This buffer has a `poll()` method which obeys `Stream` semantics, and can be used instead of
/// additional boilerplate over the `pull()` method. The buffer also has a `close()` method which
/// will irrevocably close the buffer. A closed buffer will not accept any new items, but continue
/// to serve items through the `poll()` method until it empties, at which point it will indicate
/// that the `Stream` is ended.
